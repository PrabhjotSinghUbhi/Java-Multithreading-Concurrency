## Overview of Basics

### What is a Multithreading?

- Multithreading is a programming concept that allows multiple threads to run concurrently within a single process.

- Threads are lightweight processes that share the same memory space but can execute independently.

### What is the difference between Multi Threading and Multi Tasking?

- Multi Threading is a programming concept that allows multiple threads to run concurrently within a single process, while Multi Tasking is an operating system capability that allows multiple processes to run simultaneously.

### What is the difference between Process and Thread?

- A Process is an independent program in execution, while a Thread is a smaller unit of a process that can run concurrently with other threads.

- Processes have their own memory space, while threads share the same memory space of their parent process.

- Context switching between processes is more expensive than context switching between threads due to the need to switch memory maps.

### What is a Process?

- A Process is an instance of a program in execution. It contains the program code, its current activity, and the resources allocated to it.
